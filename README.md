# structure_light_imaging\n
This repository is used to rebbuild the 3D object by the structure light in ECNU. In this reposetory, we rebuild the 3D image by the method of Fourier analysis fringe.\n
There is two functions of this repository:\n
(1) Self-adaption finding the range of Fourier spectrum\n
(2) Self-adaption camera calibration\n
